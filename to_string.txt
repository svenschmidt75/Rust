What does string_literal.to_string() do and why does is work?

String literals are of type &str, i.e.

let s: &str = "string";

There is a generic trait called ToString declared like this:

trait ToString {
    fn to_string(&self) -> String;
}

and in particular, it is implemented for &str:

impl ToString for str {
    fn to_string(from: &str) -> String {
        String::from(from)
    }
}

Actually, the trait is a little more generic in the sense that it is NOT
directly implemented for str, bur rather like this:

impl<T> ToString for T where T: Display + ?Sized {
}

This is more generic than just str, i.e. any type that implements traits
Display and ?Sized will work and str implements the std::fmt::Display trait:

impl Display for str
